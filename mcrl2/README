Install mCRL2 and LTSmin.

In the directory gen-lps, run gen_all.py.
This uses mCRL2 to generate linearized LPS files from the specifications.

Copy the generated LPS files (in gen-lps) to this directory.
Run generate.py in this directory.
This computes the LTS for each LPS as an LDD file, and then converts the LDD file to a BDD file.

Copy the BDD files to the ../models directory
