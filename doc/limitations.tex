This version of \textsc{SigrefMC} still has a few limitations.

\begin{itemize}

\item
Sylvan currently supports rational numbers using 32-bit integers.
The effect of this limitation is that fractions that require more than 32 bits in their numerator or denominator cannot be represented yet.
Rudimentary support for GMP objects exists, but is not ideal and requires an extra hash table between the GMP library and Sylvan.
True support requires a modification of the hash table inside Sylvan.

\item
Quotient extraction has been implemented, but it is not yet part of the final distribution as it requires some code cleanup. Quotient extraction is a fairly straight-forward algorithm that given a LTS/CTMC/IMC and a partition, computes the new LTS/CTMC/IMC, either in a symbolic format (not recommended due to blowup) or in explicit format.

\item
The maximum number of blocks is $2^{31}$. This is partially due to memory limitations (for $2,147,483,648$ blocks, we already require 12 gigabytes to store all signature-partition pairs, ignoring additional overhead by the skip list/hash table) and due to the design of the skip list. The limitation can be lifted easily, but then \textsc{SigrefMC} requires twice as much memory.

\end{itemize}
